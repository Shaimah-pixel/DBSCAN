In this project, DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) was applied to a dataset containing various features of penguins.
The goal was to explore natural groupings within the data without prior knowledge of the number of clusters.

Conclusion: The application of DBSCAN to the penguin dataset revealed the presence of seven clusters, each representing different groupings of penguins based on their physical attributes.
Notably, DBSCAN successfully identified several outliers or noise points, demonstrating the algorithmâ€™s ability to handle atypical data.
